        <h1>What is NMM ?</h1>
        <p>NMM is a comprehensive environmental noise measurement planning, data management, 
            data analysis and presentation tool (or those are our intentions at least). NMM
        has gorown up as a valuable tool in our everyday job at acoustic labolatory. Work with NMM reflects
        all stages we have to pass during more or less complicated environmental noise project.</p>        
        <p>Work with NMM consist of a few basic stages. In some cases it is possible to use NMM to plan
        measurements - especially plan measurement locations. After measurements, data can be imported
        into NMM and analysed. There are few tools one can use to check data, and choose best samples.</p>
        <p>Now that we have choosen best samples representing acoustic phenomenon, NMM provides several
        calculation methods (we call them here: noise source models) that can be used to calculate final
        results. Of course in simplest stuations there is no need to create noise source models.</p>
        <p>Results of every noisesource model may be presented on a few templates build into NMM.</p>
        <p>This document contains detailed description of available tools, and a few tutorials
        one can try out to become familiar with NMM concepts.</p>
