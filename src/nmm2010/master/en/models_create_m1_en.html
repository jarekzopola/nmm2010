        <h1>Road noise sampling.</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This calculation model is based on Polish reference method described in
           <span class="rozporzadzenie"> Rozporządzenie Ministra Środowiska z dnia 16 czerwca 2011 r. w sprawie wymagań w 
        zakresie prowadzenia pomiarów poziomów substancji lub energii w środowisku przez 
        zarządzającego drogą, linią kolejową, linią tramwajową, lotniskiem lub portem
        (Dz. U. z dnia 7 lipca 2011 r.)</span></p>
        <p>Obviously this method can be applied in any country, except situations where
        application of local measurement method is obligatory.</p>
        <p>Road noise sampling is based on assumption that whole day and night may be divided into
        shorter periods (in this case 24 1-hour long periods) and it is possible to
        assign those periods into groups where noise level doesn't differ more then 3dB</p>
        <p>Usually it is possible to create 4-7 such a groups. Field noise measurement is then
        required only in representative hours and Leq is calculated based on those samples.</p>
        <p>This method has advantage: it is not required to measure traffic noise 
            during 24-hour period, but it also has disadvantages: it is not so accurate as
        24-hour long measurement, and before it can be applied there must be a way to 
        identify equally "noisy" periods. And this means we need at least information on treffic volume.</p>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>The first picture shows 24 hour road noise measurement. It starts at 6 AM and lasts until 6 AM next day.
        The measurement is long enough to tell noise level for day and night without any further processing,
        however for our own purpose let's try to calculate noise level according to road noise sampling method.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>We have got information on traffice, and according to it
            is possible to create following groups of periods (look at last column).
            We used NMPB calculation method to estimate sound power level of the road
            during each hour of day and night.<br/></p>
            <img src="../images/models/road_sampling/traffic_stats.png" alt="hh"></li>            
            <li>In the next step we mark 15-minutes samples. At least 3 samples (events) for each 
            group</li>
            <li>Finally we have at least 3*6=18 samples (events) called tk1 (3 samples), tk2 (3 samples),
                ..., tk6 (3 samples)</li>
            <li>In the next step choose <span class="button">[MODELS]->[NEW MODEL]->
                    [ROAD SAMPLING]</span> and you ought to see following dialog window:
                    <img src="" alt="Road sampling method dialog window"></li>
            <li>Fill in model name - this just description for your convenience</li>
            <li>Fill in table - here you can assign sample (event) types to each hour in a day and night period.</li>
            <li>Decide if apply -3dB correction in microfone was located near reflecting surface</li>
            <li>Decide if substract L95 from measurement result</li>
            <li>Now final results are displayed in lower part of the dialog window.</li>
            <li>Press <span class="button">[OK]</span> button to add model to project.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="../images/models/road_sampling/road_sampling.png" alt="Road noise sampling model dialog window">
        <p>All created models are added to NMM project and saved on disc together with whole data. You can come
            back to the model using "Model manager" (<span class="button">[MODELS] -> [MODELS MANAGER]</span>)</p>
